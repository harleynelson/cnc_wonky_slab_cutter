gcode generation
    - Have some sort of option to strictly stay within confines of slab + margin OR create efficient box
        - Let's say we have a U shaped piece of wood, it would be less efficient to have to go all the way up and back down it
            - we should cross the gap
    - Stepover calculation based on tool diameter
    - Checkmark Option for: Return to home position at the end
    - Depth passes can be an int
    - the popups at the bottom hide our buttons, can we move it to the middle?

gcode visualization
    - appears to be on a slope even though gcode is horizontal

App wide:
    - How do we go about implementing metric vs standard without screwing up our code
    - Consider moving device-specific or display-dependent constants to a dynamic configuration
    - crashes when minimized sometimes?

Edge detection:
    - have a tap for the slab and a tap for the spillboard bor better detection
        - since slab and mdf spillboard will look too similar
Marker Detection:
    - have the user tap the general area where the markers are and then perform the blob search there to detect.
    - should we have a separate marker for the origin of the machine?
