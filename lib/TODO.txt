Appears to recognize an inner edge sometimes and conclude our search for edges that might be just a little further outward.  
    Should we build in some mechanism that when the algorithm thinks it's done...
        essentially samples a little further out from a random position along the edge
        checks if it's an edge and not a random piece of artifact?  
        And then samples a little further out from a random point along the edge.  
        Until it no longer finds edges to combine to our original slab outline?  
        We can repurpose our 'continueSearchDistance' variable so we don't have to make another.

Our post processing of contour points should probably be a parameter we should save/edit:
    contour_detection_utils.dart:
        // Post-process contour points
        // Higher the number, more circle'ee... ie 10 = blocky, 100 = smooth as a baby's bottom
            if (contourPoints.length < 40 || _calculateArea(contourPoints) < minSlabSize) {
                return createFallbackContour(width, height, seedX, seedY);
            }
