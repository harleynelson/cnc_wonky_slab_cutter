Appears to recognize an inner edge sometimes and conclude our search for edges that might be just a little further outward.  
    Should we build in some mechanism that when the algorithm thinks it's done...
        essentially samples a little further out from a random position along the edge
        checks if it's an edge and not a random piece of artifact?  
        And then samples a little further out from a random point along the edge.  
        Until it no longer finds edges to combine to our original slab outline?  
        We can repurpose our 'continueSearchDistance' variable so we don't have to make another.

Our post processing of contour points should probably be a parameter we should save/edit:
    contour_detection_utils.dart:
        // Post-process contour points
        // Higher the number, more circle'ee... ie 10 = blocky, 100 = smooth as a baby's bottom
            if (contourPoints.length < 40 || _calculateArea(contourPoints) < minSlabSize) {
                return createFallbackContour(width, height, seedX, seedY);
            }


Fix Hard coded things...
    In lib/screens/combined_detector_screen.dart:
        containerSize.height - 100 calculation for accounting for status/buttons
        Seed point indicator width/height hardcoded as 20x20
        Fixed padding values in various UI elements

    In lib/camera_screen_with_overlay.dart:
        Hardcoded marker positions using relative coordinates like size.width * 0.2

    In lib/widgets/contour_overlay.dart:
        Fixed stroke widths for drawing contours
        Hardcoded showPoints parameters

    In lib/utils/image_processing/contour_detection_utils.dart:
        Several magic numbers in algorithms like _createFallbackContour which uses width * 0.3
        Fixed values for gap handling and continuation thresholds

    In lib/widgets/camera_overlay.dart:
        Hardcoded marker positions and sizes

    In lib/utils/general/constants.dart:
        Consider moving device-specific or display-dependent constants to a dynamic configuration
